# System Design and Requirements
In this document we present our decisions about the requirements and design of what we consider essential for the development of the application:

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKmzFc-29P0-WmXrGvTMN6AKdOM88oyo6zNZZYBG550/edit?usp=sharing) we can find all the planning, prioritisation of requirements and the data model for the initial phase of the project. We have 3 principle entities: admins, vehicle owners and the users who rent cars. We have defined all the main functionalities for the 3 entities mentioned above order by priority.
For a better data model perception we have made an UML class diagram presented [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18k86meFqNtCdpcBH3wvH65j0krqlwk1X).

Beside that, we made also most of the design that weâ€™ll need to build Rent Your Ride application and the flow of the pages to make the website intuitive and logic. Below we have our [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/ITTMotJ2Gnw22UlCmWiQ6qxi/Webapp   https://www.figma.com/file/ITTMotJ2Gnw22UlCmWiQ6qxi/Webapp) where we made all the application design prototypes.
